    <h1>My first blog - initial thoughts</h1>
    <h3>6 April 2016</h3>
    <h2>
      What is your take on the DBA/EDA experience? 
    </h2>
    <p>
      From my first contact with EDA, I could tell that the organisation was different. My feeling is that they are very people focussed empowering their students to learn in different ways and sharing their passion. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are your impressions?
    </h2>
    <p>
      It's not going to be easy. There's a lot of work and learning to be done but with the support of the teachers and others in the cohort, it is all achievable. I like the wholistic approach in cultivating soft personal skills as well as the technical aspects of coding and development.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Shereef's Fireside chat, he described his course as being transformative for many people. I love the idea of being part of a group, learning together and supporting each other in a positive way. I suspect we will all discover our true selves when doing this course.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am nervous about the whole thing but I guess it's expected. If the first 3 days of phase 0 are anything to go by, there will be times of extreme frustration mixed in with a great sense of acheivement when things work out. Many highs and lows. I'm excited about meeting my cohort, working together and sharing our experiences. It's great to be part of this adventure.

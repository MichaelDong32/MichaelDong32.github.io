      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>
        Grid based design is a concept where a page is split into a number of sections on which the  content is then laid out. The result of this is a number of separate design elements positioned in a logical sequence.

      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

      <h3> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      
      <p>
        I first come across the term many years ago in relation to a breathing technique not too dissimilar to mindfulness meditation.

      <h1>HTML and CSS Udacity 1</h1>
      
      <h4>
        Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it 
  to your non-technical friend?
      </h4>
      <p>
        HTML , CSS and the DOM are terms commonly used in the web development world to describe how a webpage is put together. Each part has itâ€™s own function and performs a specific role in creating what you see on screen.

      What is your take on the DBA/EDA experience? 
    </h4>
    <p>

      <h1>Time and habit techniques</h1>
   
      <h4> Which timebox and habit techniques did you try</h4>
      <p>
        This week I have found using the pomodoro technique really helpful for keeping me focussed on a single task. I feel more productive sitting and working solidly for 25 minute chunks with small breaks in-between. It is surprised me also how much I managed to acheive.

        <p class="blog">This was week three. A lot of learning to be done, not the just the technical side but about the way I function, the way I learn and the way I react to challenges and blocks.</p>
        <p class="blog">Very enlightening.</p>

          <h5 class="blog">Process over product</h5>

          <p class="blog">During the rebuild project there were times when I struggled getting the page to look the way I wanted it to. I spent a lot of time with dev tools and searching the internet to try to find a solution often without result. There were times when I just sat in front of my screen hoping I could will my code to work. It became very frustrating and stressful.</p>

          <p class="blog">I soon came to realise that I had become totally obsessed with the product, and not the process.</p>

          <p class="blog">Once I became mindful of this, I stepped back, let it go and walked away. When I returned to the project, I reached out for help both on slack from the cohort and from EDA. Suggestions soon followed and I was able to move forward again.</p> 

          <p class="blog">My approach was different this time. I focussed more on the process and applying the time management stategies we learnt last week. I became less attached to the idea of what I wanted to create.</p>

          <p class="blog">Although I’m not entirely happy with the end result, I realise that I’m only at the beginning of this journey so I’ll be revisiting this project later on. The process of code - test - revise.</p>

          <p class="blog">Overall, the lesson I have learnt is that if you focus on your process, the product will follow.</p>


          <h5 class="blog">Search inside yourself Chapter 2</h5>

          <p class="blog">I’m very comfortable with the idea of meditation and it’s benefits. Mindfulness is something I try to practice everyday at work and at home.</p>

          <p class="blog">I found chapter 2 interesting as it confirmed some of my thoughts around meditation and the benefits to our mental and physical well being. It served as a useful reminder to meditate more on a regular basis and to approach it with intent.</p>

          <p class="blog">Having the process spelt out in a clear manner has helped me to tidy up my practice, building attentiveness and dealing with distractions.</p>

          <p class="blog">Now I just have to commit to turning it into a habit.

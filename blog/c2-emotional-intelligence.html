      <h3> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      
      <p>
        I first come across the term "Emotional Intelligence" (EI) many years ago in relation to a breathing technique not too dissimilar to mindfulness meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind this technique was to moderate the activity of our sympathethic nervous system. When this part of our nervous system is dominant, our heart rate increases, our senses are heightened, blood pressure increases, cortisol levels are raised and we are ready for that fight or flight. It is not uncommon for people to exist in this state given the stressful lives we lead.
     </p>
      <p>
        This becomes the new norm and it can have long term negative effects on our health and well being. Emotionally, we become impulsive, make bad decisions, lose focus and our work performance suffers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By using breathing as an anchor, we can decrease the heart rate variability, slow down our adrenal activity and return to a more balanced state. Long term, our blood pressure and blood sugar levels drop and our general sense of well being and happiness improves.
      </p>
      <p>
        From reading the first chapter in “Search Inside Yourself” by Chade-Meng Tan uses the same principles but with a much greater focus on the personal development side using Mindfulness meditation techniques to build emotional intelligence.
      <p>
        His approach involves three steps:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <ol><i></i>><b>Attention training</i></b> - clears and calms the mind allowing us to access higher cognitive and emotional abilities. The also creates and environment for EI to thrive</ol>
          <ol><<i><b>Self knowledge and self mastery</i></b>- being aware of our emotions and physical sensations and the understanding that we can choose how we react to these in the most appropriate way. We can detach from a situation, hold the space, think objectively rather than acting on impulse or habit.</ol>
          <ol><i><b>Creating mental habits</i></b>- framing the environment around us in terms of how we want it to be. The way you interact with people and see yourself will have a direct impact on the world around you. If you approach it with optimism, kindness, empathy, you will start to see and recognise the same qualities in the people around you.</ol>
        </ul>
      <p>
        By developing EI, we improve our self awareness, self regulation, motivation, empathy and our social / leadership skills. It supports collaboration and open communication.
      </p>

      <h3> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>
        I started the week with the goal of 2 minutes of mindfulness each morning after getting out of bed (tiny habit).
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been good to get into a regular habit again and it has made me become a lot more aware of my physical sensations and emotional changes throughout the day. Now I find myself taking mini breaks during the day, switching on that mindfulness and reminding myself to breathe properly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I even downloaded an app <a href="http://stopbreathethink.org/" class = "app"> Stop, Think and Breathe </a>to my phone as a reminder.

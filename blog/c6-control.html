            <h5 class="blog">Auto self regulation.</h5>

              <p class="blog"> The takeway from Chapter 5 of “Search Inside Yourself” for me this week was the idea of controlling our emotions rather than letting them control us.</p>

              <p class="blog"> Often our responses to certain events is determined by which emotion we are feeling at the time. This action is often habitual and is a consequence of learned behaviours from many years of reacting in a particular way. Most of the time, we are able to act appropriately but occasionally we don’t. </p>

              <p class="blog"> Wouldn’t it be good if we were able to change our behaviours  respond appropriately all the time? Well it appears we can. </p>

              <p class="blog"> The first step is the realisation that we do have a choice. The concept of auto self regulation and the emotional competencies required to achieve that is based on the idea that we can choose how we respond.</p>

              <p class="blog">The competencies are </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Self Control</strong> - keeping our impulses in check, self awareness.</li>
                  <li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> - building integrity in our work and behaviour.</li>
                  <li><strong>Conscientiousness</strong> - responsibility to ourselves and those around us</li>
                  <li><strong>Adaptibility</strong> - being flexible.<li>
                  <li><strong>Innovation</strong> - receptiveness to new ideas and approaches.</li>
                </ul>

              <h5 class="blog"> Siberian North Rail Road </h5>

              <p class="blog">Being mindful of our emotional landscape is a great start to help develop these competencies. Using the mnemonic “Siberian North Rail Road’ we can apply simple mindfulness steps to help. It goes- </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong><u>S</u></strong>top. Take a moment to pause and stop that reflex response.</li>
                  <li><strong><u>B</u></strong>reathe. Calms the mind and body, Reinforces the pause</li>
                  <li><strong><u>N</u></strong>otice. Switch into a state of mindfulness. Take notice of your physical and emotional feelings</li>
                  <li><strong><u>R</u></strong>eflect. Put things into perspective. Don’t judge and apply empathy to the situation.</li>
                  <li><strong><u>R</u></strong>espond. Respond with kindness and positivity.</li>
                </ul>

              <h5 class="blog">Dealing with difficult emotions</h5>

              <p class="blog">It’s not about suppression of or avoidance of difficult emotions, They all have their place and can be useful in the right situation. However, when they are inappropriate or counter-productive we need to be able to let them go.</p>

              <p class="blog">Meshing, where we visualise ourselves as being porous is powerful. Once we become overwhelmed by strong feelings, they are able to pass through us. We are able to experience and accept them but we are also able to let them go freely.</p>

    <h1>Reflections on the bootcamp experience</h1>
    <h3>6 April 2016</h3>
    <h2>
      What is your take on the DBA/EDA experience? 
    </h2>
    <p>
      The experience so far has been good. I like the philosophy of the academy, focussing on our soft skills and personal development alongside the technical aspects of coding.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What are your impressions?
    </h2>
    <p>
      It's not going to be easy. There's a lot of work and learning to be done but so far it has been good. The orientation exercises were a useful introduction although I didn't realise how important they were to do until I started. The resources provided are excellent and really interesting making time management difficult.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Shereef's Fireside chat, he described his course as being transformative for many people. I love the idea of being part of a group, learning together and contributing to the overall experience of the bootcamp cohort.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am nervous about the whole thing but I guess it's expected. If the first 3 days of phase 0 are anything to go by, there will be times of extreme frustration mixed in with a great sense of acheivement when things work out. Many highs and lows. I'm excited about meeting my cohort and going on this journey together.

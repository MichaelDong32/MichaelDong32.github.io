            What is your take on the DBA/EDA experience? 
          </h5>
          <p class="blog">
            The experience so far has been good. I like the philosophy of the academy, focussing on our soft skills and personal development alongside the technical aspects of coding.
          </p>
          <h5 class="blog">
            What are your impressions?
          </h5>
          <p class="blog">
            It's not going to be easy. There's a lot of work and learning to be done but so far it has been good. The orientation exercises were a useful introduction although I didn't realise how important they were to do until I started. The resources provided are excellent and really interesting making time management difficult.
          </p>

            How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
          </h5>
          <p class="blog">
            In Shereef's Fireside chat, he described his course as being transformative for many people. I love the idea of being part of a group, learning together and contributing to the overall experience of the bootcamp cohort.
          </p>
          <h5 class="blog">
            Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous
          </h5>
          <p class="blog">
            I am nervous about the whole thing but I guess it's expected. If the first 3 days of phase 0 are anything to go by, there will be times of extreme frustration mixed in with a great sense of acheivement when things work out. Many highs and lows. I'm excited about meeting my cohort and going on this journey together.

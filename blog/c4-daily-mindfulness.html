        <p class="blog">Communication is something which we do naturally in our everyday lives.</p>
        <p class="blog"> How often though have we paused to think - how well do we communicate?</p>

        <h5 class="blog">What did you learn from mindfulness conversation? How did the other person find it?</h5>

        <p class="blog">When I first read this chapter, I thought, well how hard can this be. The truth, is very hard. </p>

        <p class="blog">Generally speaking, I thought I was an active listener and that I was able to communicate well. Through this exercise, I soon came to realise that there are times when this was not the case.</p>

        <p class="blog">This exercise comprises 3 parts</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Monologue</strong> where you get to speak for 4 minutes on anything that is on your mind. During this time, you try to remain mindful and clear on what you are trying to communicate. The other person sits there actively listening, not interrupting or filling the silent spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution. </strong> You repeat back to the other person what you understood them to have said. You keep on looping this back until you have fully understood.</li>
            <li><strong>Dipping</strong> is a process of checking in with yourself to see if you are still in a state of mindfulness and not distracted by outside influences or internal chatter.</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="blog">I found that I struggled maintaining that calm state of mindfulness. I worked hard trying to think about what I wanted to say and how I was going to say it. My mind would drift off or get ahead of myself. There were also pauses at which point rather than leave them, I was grasping for something to fill the silence.</p>

        <p class="blog">During listening,  again my mind would drift this time trying to interpret what the person was saying and treating it as a memory exercise.</p>

        <p class="blog">The other components of resolution and dipping proved very useful afterwards to clarify what we were both trying to communicate to each other.</p>

        <p class="blog">It definitely felt good but needs a lot of practice. I can see it being a very useful tool to have to improve my communication skills. I can also see how beneficial it is in developing empathy.</p>

        <h5 class="blog">Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>

        <p class ="blog">The two techniques I’m going to use to sustain my practice are the two which offer the least resistance. To me, it’s all about building momentum and incorporating mindfulness into my everyday life.</p>

        <p class="blog">Whilst formal practice of 10-15 minutes daily would be ideal, it requires  self discipline and time which I don’t always have.</p>

        <p class="blog">Doing little, short spells regularly during the day would help to remind myself of being mindful of my mental and physical state even when busy or stressed. The idea of one breath at a time is an easy way to initiate the meditation and to encourage mindfulness at all times.</p>

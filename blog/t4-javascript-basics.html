        <h5 class ="blog">How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>

        <p class="blog">Last week, we created our blog site using HTML and CSS.</p>

        <p class="blog">HTML gave us the content and structure of the page, CSS enabled us to style and format it - to make it look pretty.</p>

        <p class="blog">Sites like this although looking nice, don’t really do a lot except provide information. These sites are called static sites because what you see is what you get.</p>

        <p class="blog">By using JavaScript through our site, we can improve the whole user experience by adding interactivity. JavaScript sits behind and offers functionality to the site. It can be used to store user details entered into forms. Maps rely on JavaScript as well as on-line calculators.</p>

        <p class="blog">The appearance of the website may also change based on the interaction with the user - something as simple as a click of a button. JavaScript allows all of this to happen.</p>

         <h5 class="blog">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h5>

         <p class="blog">When you write a piece of software code, the order in which each line statement is executed is called the control flow. In its simplest form, the code will run from the top to the bottom. This is called a straight control flow.</p>

          <p class="blog">Another type of control flow is called an if/else flow where the order of the program will be dependant on a conditional statement which returns a true or false statement.</p>

          <p class="blog">Looping control flows allow us to go back to the same point in the program where we were before and repeat the statement again and again until some conditional statement is met These are also known as while / do loops.</p>

          <p class="blog">An everyday example of this is like eating your breakfast. The loop works like this.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You start with your bowl of crunchy cereal goodness</li>
              <li>You take one spoonful</li>
              <li>Keep on eating until the bowl is empty - is it?</li>
              <li>Take one more mouthful</li>
            </ul>

          <p class="blog">Once the bowl is empty, the loop is broken and now you can go and get a cup of coffee.</p>

          <p class="blog">An example of the syntax for a loop is </p>

          <pre><code> for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) </code></pre>

          <h5 class="blog">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</h5>

          <p class="blog">Arrays are sets of data which are stored in an ordered list. To access this data, you have to locate it by its specific numerical index which gives us its position in the array. It may be in a single array or a nested array. </p>

          <p class="blog">One important thing to remember is that the index starts at 0 so 0 relates to position 1, 1 relates to position 2 and so on.</p>

          <p class="blog">Object literals are different. They do store data but in a less ordered manner. Each set of data has it’s own property name or key and within each key, there may be a number of properties or values associated with it. An example of this could be an object named cars. Nesting with this object may be properties such as brands, color, engine capacity etc. </p>

          <p class="blog">Accessing this data is not based on knowing it’s specific location like in an array, rather you can find it by using it’s property name or pathway to it’s location. </p>



          <h5 class="blog">Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </h5>

          <p class="blog">Functions are blocks of code or instructions which tell the computer to perform a certain task or the calculate a value.</p>

          <p class="blog">This means that we can reuse these function blocks without having to write the code out each time we want to perform the same task. </p>

          <p class="blog">To define a function you start with the function keyword followed by its name, a list of variables inside a set of parentheses followed by the programming statements enclosed in square brackets.</p>

          <p class="blog">An example of the syntax or format for this is </p>

          <pre><code> function name (var1, var2) {
              statement1;
              statement2;
              }; </code></pre>

          <p class="blog">To get the function to run, we invoke or call it by

          <pre><code> name (var1, var2): </code></pre>

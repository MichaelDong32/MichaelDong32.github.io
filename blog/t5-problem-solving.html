          <h5 class="blog">What was the problem?</h5>

            <p class="blog">This was a very challenging week for me with our first real assignment on using Javascript to build simple racing game from scratch. Although I’d done the exercises last week on introducing the language, applying it in a real life situation proved more difficult than I expected. </p>

            <p class="blog">I took a deep breath and stepped back and broke the project down into parts.</p>

            <p class="blog">>I drew up what I wanted it to look like on paper and put the different design elements into boxes. I referred back to my notes as to a reminder about coding the HTML and CSS. I was able to create a nice static page.</p>

            <p class="blog">>A Javascript program is what gives the user the ablilty to interact with that interaction. Problem solving starts by identifying what needs to be done and then creating a solution in order solve the problem.</p>

            <p class="blog">What problem solving techniques did you use?</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>I wrote down what I wanted the program to do in simple plain english steps.</li>
                <li>Pseudocode - I rewrote those steps in more detail defining the variables, functions and loops that I thought I needed. Although it was correct from a syntax perspective, it helped to give me a plan.</li>
                <li>Googling - I looked on line for similar examples to try and glean clues as to where to start and how others have approached the problem. By using Chrome dev tools, I was able to open up their JavaScript and try to understand their logic and what they did. I found sites like Stack Overflow interesting but not much use as a lot of the answers were too technical for me to understand at present.</li>
                <li>Trying code out - I would try coding and checking on the console log for the results. This was frustrating  as my limited knowledge of dev tools and debugging techniques became apparent very early on.</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky and hammock driven development - stepping away from the screen and removing myself from the task of coding gave me the greatest insights and clarity following periods of confusion.</li>
                <li>Asking for help from teachers and peers. When I got really blocked, I asked for help which cam pretty quickly both from the code help desk and from the Kea slack channel. It’s tricky. If I don’t know what the problem is, it makes it all the more difficult for someone to troubleshoot remotely. </li>
              </ol>

            <p class="blog">It was good to be able to verbalise my lack of progress in our weekly check-in. The support from the Josh and Joseph was fantastic and I was able to move through the block as they knew exactly what I needed to get started again.</p>

            <p class="blog">Having to problem solve this week was useful in identifying where my shortcomings are and what I need to concentrate on improving. Reflecting on what worked well and what not so well will guide me in the future as to which resources to use. Even though I struggled with the exercise during the week, I felt I was learning something through having to go through the process.</p>

            <p class="blog">What I need to really step up on is learning to use the Chrome Development tools properly and understanding using the console log due the development process.</p>

            <h5 class="blog">Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words</h5>

            <p class="blog">In JavaScript there are some preset methods which used to perform certain actions of the different parts (HTML elements of our webpage.</p>

            <p class="blog"><strong> .map&#40 &#41</strong></p>

            <p class="blog">The map&#40 &#41 method takes a range of data inside an array and performs a function &#40series of actions &#41 on it and returns a new array showing the new values .</p>

            <p class="blog">An example of this method is</p>

            <p class="blog">Mapping an array of numbers to an array of square roots</p>

            <p class="blog">The following code takes an array of numbers and creates a new array containing the square roots of the numbers in the first array.</p>

              <pre><code>var numbers = [1, 4, 9];
              var roots = numbers.map(Math.sqrt);
              // roots is now [1, 2, 3], numbers is still [1, 4, 9]</code></pre>

            <p class="blog"><strong>.filter &#40 &#41</strong></p>

            <p class="blog">The filter &#40 &#41 method takes the data in your array, passes it through a function which will return a value of either true or false. A new array will be created containing only those values which came back true.</p>

            <p class="blog">An example is</p>

            <p class="blog">Filtering out all small values</p>

            <p class="blog">The following example uses filter&#40 &#41 to create a filtered array that has all elements with values less than 10 removed.</p>

            <pre><code>function isBigEnough(value) {
            return value >= 10;
            }
            var filtered = [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].filter(isBigEnough);
            // filtered is [12, 130, 44]</code></pre>

            <p class="blog"><strong>.reduce&#40 &#41</strong></p>

            <p class="blog">The reduce &#40 &#41 method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array &#40from left-to-right&#41 to reduce it to a single value.</p>

            <p class="blog">The reduce &#40 &#41 takes an data in an array and runs it through a function that accumulates its value so at the end, it returns a single value. The array is reduced.</p>

            <p class="blog">An example is</p>

            <p class="blog">Sum all the values of an array</p>

            <pre><code>var total = [0, 1, 2, 3].reduce(function(a, b) {
            return a + b;
            });
            // total == 6</code></pre>

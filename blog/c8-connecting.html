          <h5 class="blog">Growing trust and sincerity</h5>

          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/Trust-chain.jpg" alt="trust">

          <p class="blog">Trust is a core value which is so important in any relationship, personal or professional.<p>

          <p class="blog">Trust is a two way thing, If you trust others, then they will trust you back. It encourages an open relationship whereby people can be honest with each other and share common values and goals. People who feel trusted and appreciated are more committed and willing to hold themselves accountable for their actions. Without trust, the opposite can happen.</p>

          <p class="blog">On reflection following reading this chapter, I feel as though I still need to work on this. Although I do trust those around me, I haven’t always been good at letting them know. In the lead up to EDA bootcamp, I am working on this. It all seems to be going well. </p>

          <h5 class="blog">Empathic listening</h5>

          <p class="blog">I didn’t formally go out of my way to practice empathetic listening. There were many times however when I reminded myself to try and listen mindfully for  emotive cues during conversations. </p>

          <p class="blog">I noticed that in a couple of situations, what the person said may not have necessarily matched what I sensed they were feeling. Other times, empathetic listening helped me to understand more deeply what they were trying to get across and made both of us more engaged and involved in the conversation.</p>

          <h5 class="blog">How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>

          <p class="blog">Building compassion and kindness through this meditation was useful in bringing to mind another persons perspective and to accept the fact that we are all different. If we adopt this approach when dealing with conflict and difficult people, we can manage the situation better, not get as angry or resentful and let go of the negativity which can last well beyond.</p>

          <p class="blog">With regular practice of this meditation, we can develop a greater sense of optimism and positivity in ourselves and the people that surround us.</p>

          <h5 class="blog">Political awareness exercise</h5>

          <p class="blog">A situation I had recently which caused me some angst was in preparation for studying with EDA and sorting out my staffing situation. In my life I generally actively go out of my way to avoid conflict so when I am confronted by it, then it becomes very challenging.</p>

          <p class="blog">The situation is, when I am away, I will need someone to cover for me in the business. A previous staff mamber has approached me recently with regards to working for us again. It makes perfect sense to offer her the role as she knows how the business runs, was my 2IC for an number of years and I have confidence that she would be able to slot in with minimal training.</p>
 
          <p class="blog">From her perspective.</p>

          <p class="blog">I had been working with someone who had been asking me for work over the past 5 years I had told her yes, we would keep her in mind and that if something came up, she would be the next person.</p>

          <p class="blog">She had come in for training without being paid and spent time in the storing familiarising herself with how things ran. She made herself available at short notice for cover and helped out a number of times. I started paying her for those days and was on the verge of formalising our arrangements so when the situation changed, she was disappointed.</p>

          <p class="blog">She could understand why I made the decision but she still felt undervalued and betrayed considering the time she had put in and her willingness to help and my informal indication of upcoming work. However, she still would like to be considered first should something come up given what has just happened.</p>

        <h5 class="blog">What is your experience of compassionate  leadership?</h5>

        <p class="blog">I my working life, I’ve pretty much been self employed or run my own business. Reading the section on compassionate leadership, I recognised a lot of similarities in how I have managed people over time.</p>
        <p class="blog"> I have believe that people perform best when they share the same goals and values as you. Understanding them outside the work environment and allowing them to get to know you in the same way encourages an open and trusting relationship. We become a close knit family - supporting and helping each other through difficult times and sharing our goals and ambitions.</p>

        <p class="blog">When you see it from that perspective, the concept of compassionate leadership then becomes even more important as you become the role model not just for individual staff members but the entire business itself.</p>



        <h5 class="blog">The multiplying goodness meditation</h5>

        <p class="blog">I found this practice quite difficult. My mind tended to wander a lot especially when trying to multiply goodness. It really helped when I decided to focus my attention on something which gives me much joy and pleasure - my daugher and connect with the emotion through my heart. Once I was able to do this, it came much easier. </p>

        <h5 class="blog"> Tonglen meditation.</h5>

        <p class="blog">This meditation was good although it did take me to some pretty dark places within myself. I had to consciously work on turning the situation around and transforming it into a positive situation.</p>
        <p class="blog"> I haven’t repeated this one too often this week but I can certainly see its benefits especially around building empathy and compassion to others suffering.</p>

         <h5 class ="blog"> The SCARF model and EDA</h5>

        <p class="blog">I’ve not come across the SCARF model so it was interesting reflecting on how it applied to me in the past.</p>

        <p class="blog">It's helped put my put my thoughts and worries about EDA into perspective.</p>

        <p class="blog"><strong>Status</strong></p>
        <p class="blog">This has been quite challenging to me. Throwing myself into something totally foreign has stripped away any sense of status. It has been confronting as I’ve always felt capable and confident in the work I do. Not being able to do something is new and comparing my current level of understanding to others a bit further on in the development journey doesn’t help.</p>
        <p class="blog"> I’ve never been one to think about status but now it has been challenged, I can see it is important to me in terms of my own sense of self worth. There is hope though. I look back at where I started and what I have achieved and I’m pretty content. </p>
        <p class="blog"> I trust all will be fine.</p>

        <p class="blog"><strong>Certainty</strong></p>
        <p class="blog">Nothing is truly certain in the world. Even in situations when life seems secure and stable, things can change at any time. I’m aware of this and doing the EDA bootcamp is adding to this feeling of uncertainty.</p>
        <p class="blog">However, I view uncertainty with a degree of excitement because it creates opportunity for change and growth. I feel stretched, I feel unsure as to my future, I feel anxious and nervous but I also feel excited.</p>

        <p class="blog"><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>
        <p class="blog">I chose to do this course because I wanted to feel challenged to do something new.</p>
        <p class="blog">In the Scarf model, they describe “autonomy is the perception of exerting control over one’s environment. I believe that we all possess this quality, and whether consciously or unconsciously, we made the decision on our own to do the bootcamp. I also believe it is up to us to decide where it will lead us.</p>

        <p class="blog"><strong>Relatedness</strong></p>
        <p class="blog">Everyone I’ve met from the cohort and at Dev academy have been great. We all share the same idea of wanting to learn code in a supportive way. I’m sure that working in the fully immersive bootcamp environment will build strong relationships and that will grow that sense of relatedness.</p>

        <p class="blog"><strong>Fairness</strong></p>
        <p class="blog">Treat each other with respect, kindness and fairness. Be honest and willing to help each other. This is one of the core values declared by Dev Academy. Nice. </p>



        <h5 class="blog">A difficult conversation</h5>

        <p class="blog">I’m generally a non confrontational person so I try to avoid difficult conversations.</p>
        <p class="blog">The idea of rehearsing the conversation either with someone or in your head is always useful as is trying to remain emotionally detached. I have found mindfulness to be helpful here. Anything that improves communication is good so employing a technique like mindful listening would be beneficial. Gaining an insight into the other person’s perspective helps with our empathy and ability to respond with kindness in trying to find a solution which benefits both sides.</p>

        <p class="blog">I can’t remember when I last had to do this but armed with these tools, I feel better prepared.</p>

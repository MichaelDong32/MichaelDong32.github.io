          <h5 class="blog">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>

          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/sky.jpg" alt="sky">

          <p class="blog">From my own experience, by being mindful, we can become more aware of our true self. As described in the book, our mind can become cluttered. We get caught in physical as well as emotional states which then drive how we perceive the environment around us.</p>

          <p class="blog">By taking a step back and detaching ourselves from the moment, we can change way we see things and can choose to respond or react in a different manner.</p>

          <h5 class="blog">Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter &#40 Body Scan, Journaling &#41. </h5>

          <h5 class="blog">What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>


          <p class="blog">I found the body scan exercise very helpful for aiding focus on my meditation practice. I was able to release areas of tension more readily by becoming more aware of each location and breathing through it.</p>

          <p class="blog">Journaling is something which I have never been good at. I find that it becomes more or a brain dump and I end up going on all sorts of tangents and to places I never intended going to. Setting a time limit of 3 minutes would be helpful for me as it would prevent me from rambling on.</p>

          <h5 class="blog">What did you take away from the &#34 "My Emotions are Not Me" &#34 section?</h5>

          <p class="blog">The main thing I took away from this section was that emotions, feelings and thoughts are temporary and change all the time. They are part of us but do not define us.</p>

          <p class="blog">An analogy of passing clouds in the sky is extremely powerful and speaks to me about the ever changing states within ourselves, sometimes stormy, sometimes overcast but mainly fine.</p>

      My time with EDA is going to be very interesting as time management has never been a strong suit of mine. I have taken to using the Pomodoro technique and finding that very useful. What it has shown me is that by splitting a task into 25 minute chunks, it is possible to concentrate and focus on a task for a long period of time. It has surprised me.

      The idea of flow comes with these periods of intense concentration. The work has been challenging so there is enough to keep me engaged. The instant feedback of correct code is a great motivator to keep going. There have been a number of times when I've been so into the task at hand, I've lost all sense of time and forgotten about the timer!

      I've started up my meditation practice again and have enjoyed it. What is does for me especially in the morning is that it gives me clarity in terms of what I need to do for the day. Using it or even just being aware of my breathing during the day whilst working helps to ease the anxiety of all the work that needs to be done and helps keep things in perspective.

      Which takes us to the formation of new habits. Embarking on this course of study and changing career can't help but create many new habits and ways of thinking. I really like BJ Fogg's method changing our behaviour through the use of tiny habits. I'll see how many press ups I can do this time next year!

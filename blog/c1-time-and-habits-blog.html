          <h5 class="blog"> Which timebox and habit techniques did you try</h5>
          <p class="blog">
            This week I have found using the pomodoro technique really helpful for keeping me focussed on a single task. I feel more productive sitting and working solidly for 25 minute chunks with small breaks in-between. It is surprised me also how much I managed to acheive. 
          </p>
          <p class="blog">Thhe other thing I've been working on is
            getting back into a regular meditation practice and focussing on my breathing. 
          </p>

          <h5 class="blog"> What did you find interesting?</h5>
          <p class="blog">
            I've come across most of the concepts in some shape or form in the past. However, reading them and reflecting on how they can be applied to my own situation now makes them a lot more relevant and applicable. 
          </p>
          <p class="blog">
            For instance, the article on tiny habits and starting small. I can see how useful those habits will be for learning keyboard shortcuts / improving keyboard skills just by doing a small amount each day
          </p>
          <h5 class="blog">What worked for you?</h5>
          <p class="blog">
            Pomodoro definitely helped although I think using the concept of timeboxing (new term for me) may improve my time allocation. I found that on occasions, I was able to get into the "flow", I was challenged and worked hard to get through it but lost total sense of time and what else was going on around me.

          </p>
          <h5 class="blog">Which will you experiment with further</h5>
          <p class="blog">
            This week I'm going to continue with learning my shortcuts in small chunks. I'd like to be more regular and committed to a daily meditation and also reflection at the end of each learning session.
